<b>How it work?</b>

- Get the original 'string.xml' (or the URL to the same) from your developer (or from the source repo, if the app is open-source).
- Import the same (from 'sdcard' or from URL) to the Translator (Settings --> Import 'string').
- The app will list each and every translatable string as separate entries.
- Click on each of them and replace the original text with the translation from your language.
- Please follow on-screen instructions to avoid mistakes (RED colour - Error).
- Once you finished, save your work by clicking the save button on the bottom (or on Settings --> View 'string').
- Send the new xml file generated at 'sdcard' to your developer and patiently wait for an update
